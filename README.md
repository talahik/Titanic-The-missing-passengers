# Titanic-The-missing-passengers
## Project Overview
In the year 2912, after an unfortunate collision with a space-time anomaly, the Spaceship Titanic lost a significant portion of its 13,000 passengers, transporting them to another dimension. While the outcome for 8,693 passengers is known, the fate of 4,277 passengers remains a mystery.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger was transported to another dimension or not. This model will help estimate the number of passengers still missing and inform the rescue mission by determining the optimal size for the rescue spaceship.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on 8,693 passengers whose outcomes are known and 4,277 whose fate is yet to be determined. The variables provided for each passenger are:

- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- HomePlanet: The planet the passenger embarked from.
- CryoSleep: Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into cryogenic sleep during the journey.
- Cabin: The cabin number where the passenger stayed.
- Destination: The planet where the passenger is set to disembark.
- Age: The passenger's age.
- VIP: Whether the passenger paid for special VIP services during the voyage.
- RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck: The amount the passenger spent at each of the Spaceship Titanic’s luxury amenities.
- Name: The passenger’s first and last name.
- Transported: The target variable, indicating whether the passenger was transported to another dimension.
